# MythicKeys

MythicKeys is a client-side mod for Minecraft, which allows your client to receive and send keypresses between servers using the MythicKeys plugin.
This mod must be used on a server utilizing the [MythicControl](https://github.com/alvindimas05/MythicControl) to add proper functionality.
